# Project

We had to analyze a dataset provided by the Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA), consisting of a sample of the results of one of its recent fundraising appeals, in order to develop different customers segmentations to help PVA understand and forecast donors behaviour and perceive potential donation opportunities, producing a marketing report.
This customer segmentation is made by separating the donors into groups (clusters) based on the characteristics they share.
